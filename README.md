# Tkinter Basic Calculator

This Python application built with Tkinter is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on integers. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to input numbers and perform calculations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used to develop the application.
- **Tkinter**: Python's standard GUI toolkit for creating graphical interfaces.

## Description

The calculator GUI offers buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), a decimal point (.), an equals sign (=), and a clear button. Users can input numbers and perform calculations by clicking the appropriate buttons.

### Functionality

- **add_expression**: Appends the pressed button's value (digit or operator) to the expression to be calculated.
- **equal**: Evaluates the expression and displays the result on the label.
- **clear**: Clears the expression.

### GUI Components

- **Main Window**: The primary window of the calculator.
- **Result Label**: Displays the expression and the calculated result.
- **Buttons**: Various buttons for digits, operators, equals, and clear.

## How to Use

Run the Python script, and the calculator GUI will appear. Use the buttons to input numbers and perform calculations. Press the "Clear" button to reset the expression.

## Usage

To run the program, execute the Python script:

```bash
python tkinter_basic_calculator.py
```

**Note:** This assumes the file containing the code is named `tkinter_basic_calculator.py`. Adjust the command according to your actual file name if necessary.
